## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Validation (Days 1-3)
**Goal:** 5 pre-orders before building anything

**Validation Script:**
*"Hi [Business Name], I'm building a simple tool that tracks where you show up when people search '[your service] near me' on Google. Would you pay â‚¬19/month to get a weekly email showing your ranking vs competitors? Takes 2 minutes to set up."*

**Target Businesses:**
- Local plumbers (search Google Maps for your city)
- Dentist offices  
- Hair salons
- Auto repair shops
- Restaurants

**Validation Channels:**
- Direct LinkedIn messages to business owners
- Facebook local business groups

- Google My Business message feature

### Phase 2: MVP Development (Days 4-7)
**Day 4:** Set up Supabase, Stripe, basic authentication
**Day 5:** Build rank checking functionality
**Day 6:** Create simple dashboard + email reports
**Day 7:** Deploy, test with beta customers

### Phase 3: Launch (Days 8-10)  
**Day 8:** Onboard first 5 paying customers
**Day 9:** Collect feedback, iterate quickly
**Day 10:** Social proof + testimonials
